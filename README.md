A customer-facing support portal with an internal agent dashboard built for **Titan Limited**.

## Overview

OctoCare demonstrates how modern enterprises can reduce support load, improve customer experience, and bring AI into the software delivery process safely — using GitHub from idea to production.

## Customer Features

## Demo Storyline

1. A customer reports a damaged product through the website
2. The support dashboard shows the new case
3. AI summarizes the issue, classifies priority, and suggests the next action
4. A GitHub Issue is created for a missing feature: photo upload for damaged claims
5. Copilot helps implement the feature
6. Copilot Code Review catches missing validation or accessibility problems
7. CodeQL and dependency review run in the PR
8. GitHub Actions deploys the app
9. The live site now supports image upload and better case triage
